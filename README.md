# alu
arithmetic logic unit

This ALU is designed for Cyclone FPGA, using Altera tools. Except for flip flops, all other behavior is coded at Register Transistor Level (RTL) or is described using Boolean logic.

A complete description is given in the Project 1 report pdf. this PDF includes the code for the control bits to change function, as well as talks about design process
