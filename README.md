# alu
arithmetic logic unit

This ALU is designed for Cyclone FPGA, using Altera tools. Except for flip flops, all other behavior is coded at Register Transistor Level (RTL) or is described using Boolean logic.

the function is controlled by 2 control bits, the associated functions can be found in the document, EE421-Project-1.pdf.  
A description of the design process and simulations can be found in the document, James Condie_ee_421_proj1.pdf .
