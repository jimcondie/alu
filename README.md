# alu
arithmetic logic unit

This ALU was tested on Cyclone FPGA, using Altera tools, but should work with any as long as all component files are appropriately linked.  It has been optimized to my best ability to occupy as few cells as possible.  But any further optimizations are welcomed. Except for flip flops, all behavior is coded at Register Transistor Level (RTL), in other words is described using Boolean logic.

the function is controlled by 2 control bits, the associated functions can be found in the document, EE421-Project-1.pdf.  
A description of the design process and simulations can be found in the document, James Condie_ee_421_proj1.pdf .
